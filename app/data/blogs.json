In this short article we cover some of the insights from the session: thinking about what subjects and themes narratives might cover, who they're for, who is telling them and how they should be delivered.",

Our LEAP members were asked to use our prototype to 'bookmark' up to four narratives that they felt were valuable. They were asked to use two approaches to discover narratives: i. <i>Structured browsing</i>: an interface with thumbnails of videos alongside titles and summaries, with simple filters to refine the list of available videos and ii. <i>A conversational interface</i> that provides clips from narratives in response to discussions.

Rather than offer support, they may cause frustration, distress, or feelings of exclusion. How might we design to mitigate this risk?",

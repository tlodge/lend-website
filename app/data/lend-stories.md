# What makes LEND stories land?

As we dug into this theme, we started unpacking what gives LEND narratives their power—and where they can fall flat. Four ingredients kept coming up: the content itself, who it’s for, who’s telling it, and how it’s delivered. Together, they shape whether a story truly resonates.

## What the stories are for

People wanted narratives that do different jobs at different moments. We heard about four broad types:

1. **Informational** — clear, step-by-step guidance through options, services, and stages of the disease.  
2. **Educational** — correcting myths and widening public understanding.  
3. **Shared-experience** — lived stories that build reassurance, empathy, and trust.  
4. **Hope-oriented** — highlighting positive experiences, ongoing interests, and quality of life.

Crucially, information needs shift across the dementia journey—pre-diagnosis, diagnosis, progression, and later stages—so the mix of stories should shift too.

## Who the stories are for

We began thinking about people with dementia and primary carers, but the audience is wider. Family members, friends, wider support networks, and even the general public all benefit. Designing with these groups in mind can improve understanding and make day-to-day interactions easier.

## Who tells the story (and why it matters)

Authenticity was a deal-breaker. First-person accounts from people with lived experience carried the most trust—especially when cultural identity was reflected accurately. Trust eroded when someone spoke *for* others, when culture was misrepresented, or when professionals slipped from explaining options into prescribing decisions. The takeaway: narrators need to **stay in their lane**—align the voice, the subject, and the audience.

## How the story is delivered

Production choices also matter. Slick, highly produced videos can sometimes dilute authenticity. Over-editing risks cutting the critical details—especially around moments of shock or major transition—that help people prepare. And while our prototype used video only, preferences varied: some people wanted audio-only; others saw real potential in animation.

**In short:** match the story type to the moment, widen the audience lens, keep the narrator authentic, and choose a format that preserves the messy, human details people actually need.

In our most recent Lived Experience Advisory Panel workshop we presented a very early stage prototype to get a little feedback and discussion on features of our intervention. Prior to using the prototype, the panel were asked to ‘bookmark’ up to four narratives that they felt were valuable. They were asked to use two approaches to discover narratives: Structured browsing: a ‘catalogue’ interface with thumbnails of videos alongside titles and summaries, with simple filters to refine the list of available videos and a conversational interface that provides clips from narratives in response to discussions.   

## Richness of requirements and 'co-identification'

Even within this brief exercise, participants described a wide range of requirements for narratives: seeking information, shared experiences, cultural resonance, advice, and opportunities to reflect on previously viewed material. For shared-experience narratives in particular, several participants looked for close alignment with their own circumstances, including gender, relationship roles, dementia type, and specific lived experiences.

These early observations suggest the potential value of **narrative co-identification**, where conversational, back-and-forth exchanges help gather details that match to appropriate narratives. From our discussions around [narrative content](./theme2) we know there is a risk of causing frustration and offence if the narratives that are provided fail to meet (what can be quite specific) requirements. Perhaps we need to not only consider how to best ensure that matches are accurate, but whether we can identify when the support intended by a narrative may be undermined.

## Scaffolding the narrative lifecycle 

We have tended to view a narrative intervention as a two-stage process; discovery and delivery (with perhaps basic feedback at the end). However we also observed, with the conversational interface, that some participants discussed narratives that they'd already watched.  This is potentially significant; can and should we do more to support reflection on a narrative?  Might this amplify the benefits, might it help provide better recommendations? Here are a few hypotheses to explore further:

- Structured reflection may amplify benefits.
- Post-narrative discussion may yield richer, more nuanced feedback.
- Referencing previously viewed narratives may help users articulate complex or hard-to-express needs.

## The ambiguous role of conversational agents

We observed ambiguity about the AI chatbot’s role. Open-ended interactions sometimes elicited personal disclosures and expectations of emotional support. This raises safeguarding concerns. If users expect conversations to address unmet emotional needs, systems must provide validated specialist support. 

Conversationally mediated narrative discovery shows clear potential, but must be designed with attention to personalisation, cultural sensitivity, and user safety, alongside transparency of AI’s role and limitations.  

We have submitted an abstract for a poster that summarises some of these early observations to the University of Nottingham's Dementia Showcase.  We'll link to it here if our submission is successful.

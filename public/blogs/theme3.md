# How might narratives cause harm?

 In the most recent Lived Experience Advisory Panel, we learned how narratives may cause harm when they are poorly aligned with usersâ€™ circumstances, expectations, or identities.  Rather than offer support, they may cause frustration, distress, or feelings of exclusion. How might we design to mitigate this risk?

## What makes a poor narrative?

Not an exhaustive list, but here are a few key risks to consider:

- Unrepresentative content
- Unconvincing or inauthentic narrators
- Omission or trivialisation of key experiences
- Emotionally challenging material
- Cultural insensitivity
- Patronising content

## Anticipating whether a narrative might be harmful
Potential harms are not always predictable. Content that is distressing for one individual, or at one point in time, may be valuable or affirming for the same individual at another moment. This variability makes it difficult to anticipate and avoid all negative impacts in advance.  We considered approaches to mitigate risks, all of which we'll investigate further:

1. **Anticipation and preparation**: Provide clear summaries that outline the scope and trajectory of a narrative so users can make informed choices.
2. **Transparency about limitations**: Clearly acknowledge that no single narrative can fully represent personal experiences.
3. **Flexible access (rather than fixed filters)**: Avoid permanent blocks; enable users to decide, moment by moment, whether to engage with particular material.
4. **Narrative alignment**: Align storyteller, subject matter, and cultural or personal identity to support authenticity and trust.
5. **Opportunities for reflection**: Offer spaces or tools for users to respond to and process narratives. Might this help to redress moments of discomfort or distress.

Taken together, these early observations point to a core design challenge: maximising the benefits of dementia narratives while anticipating, minimising, and, where possible, redressing potential harms.

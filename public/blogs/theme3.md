# How might narratives cause harm?

 In the most recent Lived Experience Advisory Panel, we learned how narratives may cause harm (frustration, distress, feelings of exclusion) when they are poorly aligned with usersâ€™ circumstances, expectations, or identities. Though not an exhaustive list, our discussions identified several ways a narrative might be problematic:

- Unrepresentative content
- Unconvincing or inauthentic narrators
- Omission or trivialisation of key experiences
- Emotionally challenging material
- Cultural insensitivity
- Patronising content

Paying careful attention to the presentation and content of a story is only a (small) part of our job. User context, is, as ever, key; a person's own experiences will strongly shape how they respond to a narrative.  One participant had a strong reaction to a 'serving hatch' at a cafe as it represented *'...everything I dreaded about joining a support group - serving hatch, cup of tea, elderly lady'*.  In another case a participant found that a narrative was *'relevant'*, but with *'no explanation as to why he (was) immediately told (he) needed a care home'*.  

Each example illustrates how a viewer's own experiences shape their reactions; in the first case, the participant is frustrated when confonted with a somewhat stereotypical view of dementia (unrepresentative of her own situation), in the latter, the choice of whether her partner should move to a care home resonates with her, yet when the narrative doesn't deal with the significance of this decision it appears to trivialise a significant challenge. 

It's unlikely that we can ever know (or collect) enough of a user's experiences, background and beliefs to wholly remove the risk of a mismatched narrative; neither should that be our entire focus.  But we must consider how we can make it less likely.

## Lowering the risk of harmful narratives

What options are available to reduce the harmful effects of a narrative? There are **five** areas where we can focus our efforts.  Four of them focus on preventing the delivery of a potentially harmful narrative, the fifth may provide support if a narrative causes harm.  

1. **Narrative production** Although we suspect that most harms will emerge when narratives are mismatched, our discussuions revealed some core concerns that might be dealt with when narratives are first produced. We must pay careful attention to the choice of narrator (that they can authentically discuss a chosen topic). We must ensure that sufficient attention paid to known key events (loss of independence was a highly emotive discussion in the workshop). We must ensure the narrative respectful and/or representative of different cultures or under-served communities.
2. **Narrative coverage** Ensure a broad, representative range of narratives. Do we adequately represent different cultures, communities, types and stages of dementia, gender, relationship to person with dementia? 
3. **User intent** Establish and match a user's intent to an appropriate narrative. This is not an insignificant challenge. We must be able to pick out what matters to a user and infer what is valuable, based on their experiences, world view, needs and immediate situation. Immediate situation is interesting; we discussed how content that is distressing for a person at one point in time may be valuable or affirming, for the same person, at another time.
4. **Signposting and anticipation** There is plenty we can do to help ensure, prior to watching, that a user's expectations are appropriately managed. There is something here about laying the foundations for the known limitations of the intervention, such as acknowledging that no single narrative can fully represent personal experiences. We also expect it'll be useful to provide pre-watch summaries that outline the scope and trajectory of a narrative.  Finally, and perhaps most interesting, is 'content warnings'.  Why most interesting?  Put simply, even the viewers may not be aware, a-priori, what content will be distressing; one of our participants became distressed at a discussion about revoking a driving licence - something she admitted she'd not known would affect her so strongly.  There is no such thing as a complete or universal set of content warnings; they'll need to develop and grow as a user discovers and consumes narratives. 
5. **Reflection** We suspect, from observations on how workship participants used our prototype, that there is a place for supporting reflection on watched narratives. We found that the conversational interface lent itself to follow-up discussions (several participants, unbidden by us, discussed they liked and disliked about what they'd watched). Might reflection also help to redress moments of discomfort or distress? 


## In summary

Taken together, these early observations point to a core design challenge: maximising the benefits of dementia narratives while anticipating, minimising, and, where possible, redressing potential harms.  To do this effectively, perhaps our intervention must understand more about the user than the content it provides.

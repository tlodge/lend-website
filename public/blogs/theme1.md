In our most recent Lived Experience Advisory Panel workshop we discussed the *value* of dementia narratives. Which features of a narrative are most likely to shape impact? To summarise some of what we learned, we'll break this down into four parts: the content itself (what the stories are about), who they’re for, who’s telling them, and how they’re delivered. We’ll dig into each of these a little more in the rest of this article:

## What the stories are about

This was our “take a step back” question. What should be in a narrative? Perhaps unsurprisingly, our participants discussed narratives that do different jobs at different moments. We can broadly classify four types:

1. **Informational** : narratives covering options, services, and stages of the disease.
2. **Educational** : correcting myths and widening public understanding.
3. **Shared-experience** : lived stories that build reassurance, empathy, and trust.
4. **Hope-oriented** : highlighting positive experiences, ongoing interests, and quality of life.

Narratives can, of course, be a mix of the above. We distinguish between “shared-experience” and “hope-oriented” narratives. The purpose of “shared-experience” narratives, perhaps, is to reaffirm a sense that “it’s not just me,” and “I’m not alone.” They will likely have the greatest impact when they reflect similarities to the viewer’s own experiences. Hope-oriented narratives, in contrast, emphasise positive ways that people live with dementia.

## Who the stories are for

Narratives will address different needs at different times for a variety of audiences. Not only will people’s needs shift with the progression of dementia; they’ll also be affected by circumstance, experience, and immediate situation. We discussed common misconceptions of dementia—from a lack of appreciation of different stages, to simplistic assumptions about types and impacts of symptoms, and views about the ages and abilities of people living with dementia. We heard examples where these misconceptions resulted in uncomfortable, patronising, or even harmful interactions and exchanges. There is, then, another group of narrative consumers we must consider: extended family members, friends, wider support networks, and even the general public. There is a hope and belief that addressing and correcting common misconceptions and assumptions will have a positive effect on people directly affected by dementia.

## Who tells the story (and why it matters)

Though this is a lesson we’ve already learned in other narrative-based projects—authenticity is critical. From our own discussions, first-person accounts from people with lived experience carry the most trust; there would need to be good reason to stray from this. When our participants were presented with a range of narratives, one mentioned disliking a particular clip where a narrator spoke on behalf of someone else. It was also clearly important that cultural identity is reflected accurately. One participant discussed how one narrative felt “whitewashed” when the narrator described a partner’s culture (e.g., their cooking) rather than providing the partner’s own commentary.

There is a strong expectation that narrators must *stay in their lane* and not stray outside an implicit remit. For example, a participant expressed a desire for medical professionals to explain options, but not to prescribe decisions (they don’t know my situation).

## How the story is delivered

Production choices also matter. Slick, highly produced videos may dilute authenticity. One participant mentioned how over-editing risks cutting the critical details that people find valuable or even necessary. And while our prototype used video only, preferences varied: some people wanted audio-only; others saw potential in animation.

**In short**: narratives have a broad scope, a potentially wide audience and a wide range of needs. These are early but illuminating observations that will help us focus our efforts for the next workshop!

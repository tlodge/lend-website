In our most recent Lived Experience Advisory Panel workshop we discussed the *value* of dementia narratives. How can they offer support and which features are most likely to create a positive impact? We have broken down what we learnt into four parts: the content itself (what the stories are about), who they’re for, who’s telling them, and how they’re delivered. We’ll dig into each of these a little more in the rest of this article:

## What the stories are about

This was our “take a step back” question. When and how might narratives be helpful? Perhaps unsurprisingly, our participants discussed narratives that do different jobs at different moments. We can broadly classify four types:

1. **Informational** : narratives covering options, services, and stages of the disease.
2. **Educational** : correcting myths and widening public understanding.
3. **Shared-experience** : lived stories that build reassurance, empathy, and trust.
4. **Hope-oriented** : highlighting positive experiences, ongoing interests, and quality of life.

Narratives can, of course, be a mix of the above. We're distinguishing between “shared-experience” and “hope-oriented” narratives. Perhaps the primary purpose of “shared-experience” narratives is to reaffirm a sense that “it’s not just me,” and “I’m not alone.” When these narratives are similar to the viewer’s own experiences they may have a greater impact. Hope-oriented narratives, in contrast, emphasise positive ways that people live with dementia. 

We learned that narratives will address different needs at different times for a variety of audiences. Not only will people’s needs shift with the progression of dementia; they’ll also be affected by circumstance, experience, and immediate situation.

## Who the stories are for

The beneficiaries of the LEND project are people living with dementia and their carers but *the consumers of narratives will cover a broader range of people*. We leaerned how common misconceptions of dementia (from a lack of appreciation of different stages, to simplistic assumptions about types and impacts of symptoms, and views about the ages and abilities of people living with dementia) can result in uncomfortable, patronising, or even harmful interactions and exchanges. By delivering narratives to, for example: extended family members, friends, wider support networks, and even the general public, narratives might address and correct common misconceptions and assumptions.  This may, in turn, benefit people directly affected by dementia.

## Who tells the story (and why it matters)

This is a lesson we’ve already learned in similar projects: authenticity is key. In this workshop, we noted an expectation that narrators must *stay in their lane*; that stories shared directly by people with lived experience will perhaps gain more trust. When participants were presented with a range of narratives, one mentioned disliking when a narrator spoke on someone else’s behalf. Another, when expressing a desire for narratives where medical professionals explain options, was also adamant that they must **not** prescribe decisions (they don’t know *my* situation). Given the lack of culturally appropriate information and resources, there is a heightened need to ensure that cultural identity is represented accurately and respectfully. For example, one participant questioned why, when a narrator described his partner’s culture, it wad filtered ('whitewashed') through an outside perspective rather than conveyed directly.  But is authenticity more important in some *types* of narrative than others?  Presumably the closer a 'shared-experience' narratives are to a viewer's own situation, the more authentic it will feel? Or perhaps the more sensitive the viewer to anything that feels inauthentic.

## How the story is delivered

Production choices matter.  We'd like to dig into this a little more in a later session but a few observations so far:  i. Slick, highly produced videos may dilute authenticity. ii. Over-editing risks cutting (and trivialising) critical details that people find valuable or even necessary. iii. We must consider and evaluate other delivery approaches: while our prototype used video only, preferences varied: one participant wanted audio-only (and refused to engage with our prototype); another discussed the potential of animation.

**In short**: narratives have a broad scope, a potentially wide audience and a wide range of needs. We may need to treat different narratives types differently; to design our interventions to fit with a narrative's purpose, its content and the risks of delivery.
